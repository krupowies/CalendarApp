# Mobile application supporting the organization of training :swimmer:

Welcome to "CalendarApp" repo where I present my diploma project. :mortar_board:

### In a nutshell :

The aim of the work is to design and create a mobile application that will support the process of organizing training and creating training plans. The application is intended for people of all skill levels who are interested in using coaching services. The work is also aimed at getting acquainted with the issues of creating solutions that improve communication between the service provider and the recipient. Taking into account the specific relationship between coaches and players, the application is characterized by a different logic than classic online booking systems. The project is designed with broad development opportunities in mind.
The work also focuses on issues related to the creation of modern native applications for mobile devices with the iOS system. The project was implemented using a non-relational database and serverless architecture.

## App funcionality

:point_right: Athlete is receiving training units from his coach and sees them on his calendar.
